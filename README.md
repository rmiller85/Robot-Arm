# ~~Robot-Arm~~ Screw Sorter
Vann & Rowan's ~~Robot Arm~~ project: a screw sorter!

# Final Product:
``[picture]``

# Planning

## Basic Idea
Screws are dropped into a basket of sorts with a long rectangular hole down the center. This makes them hang with the heads on top, holding the screw up. The screws slide down this basket for a few centimeters, then two things happen: the hole widens so that a screw hanging straight will fall, and they slide against a plate underneath which pushes them into a 45 degree angle. They will continue sliding down the basket, but the plate that they are leaning against will have openings which match the screw lengths. This way, when a screw reaches an opening that fits its length, it straightens out and falls through. From there, it falls into a bucket. This is how the screws will be sorted. From here, our arm will finally have a purpose. It will likely be a cartesian arm, but this could change. It will reach down into the buckets, pick up a handful of screws, and move them into predetermined locations where the actual screw buckets will be placed. The idea is that you dump a bunch of unsorted screws in and go do something else. All the while, the sorter will be working. When you come back, the screws are back in their containers, but sorted. We were partially inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA69V4txt-M&t=364s).

Update: the robot arm was deemed unnecessary and pointless.

## Predicted Problems:
Screws won't line up properly

# Execution

## First Prototype
We began work on the rails which would serve as the main function of our machine.
